This is where we work every day, exploring many of the ideas that might become part of a future neighbourhood.\n\nFundamental to our process is co-creation. This means making the ideas we’re exploring accessible to everyone, creating a venue for new ideas from the community to emerge, and workshopping ideas together. We believe this open process will help create a much better neighbourhood — a place that is inclusive and can become a beacon for people-centred urban innovation.

This means making the ideas we’re exploring accessible to everyone, creating a venue for new ideas from the community to emerge, and workshopping ideas together. We believe this open process will help create a much better neighbourhood — a place that is inclusive and can become a beacon for people-centred urban innovation.
