          &quot;Many organizations have internal review processes that consider
          the potential benefits, risks and implications for privacy for new
          technologies or data collection activities. For example, in Canada,
          Privacy Impact Assessments are often conducted by organizations prior to
          the beginning for a project - find out more [here] (<a

          Depending on the jurisdiction and type of data, data is regulated in

          by federal, provincial, and municipal laws. The collection, use and
          disclosure of Personal Information by private companies in Ontario is
          regulated by the [Personal Information Protection and Electronic
          Documents Act] (<a

        <td>De-identified</td>
        <td>
          Data that is processed to remove identifying values, usually to protect
          privacy. De-identification can happen at any point in a data collection
          process, for example before it is stored in a database, or before it is
          published. Here we define it to mean after the data has already left a
          hardware device, or after it has been stored in a database. Find out
