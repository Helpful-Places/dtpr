name: Privacy-Preserving Transformation
id: privacy-preserving
description: A technology that modifies data to remove or obscure personally
  identifiable information while preserving the underlying patterns needed for
  analysis. These systems apply techniques such as masking, tokenization, or
  aggregation to protect individual privacy. In public spaces, de-identification
  processing enables valuable insights from data collection without compromising
  personal information. The technology typically creates a barrier between raw
  collected data and the information used for decision-making.
