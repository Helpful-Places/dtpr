description: The risk that AI systems make decisions through processes that are
  difficult or impossible for humans to understand or explain. This lack of
  transparency makes it challenging to identify errors, biases, or other issues.
  Mitigations may include using interpretable AI models when possible,
  developing explanation methods, and maintaining documentation of system design
  and training processes.
