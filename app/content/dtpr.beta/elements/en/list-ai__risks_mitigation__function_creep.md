name: Unforeseen Use or Function Creep
id: function_creep
description: The risk that AI systems originally deployed for specific, limited
  purposes gradually expand in scope or are repurposed for applications beyond
  their original intent without proper evaluation or transparency. What begins
  as a system for one purpose (e.g., traffic management) might expand to others
  (e.g., law enforcement) without adequate assessment of new risks or public
  notification. This can undermine public trust and potentially lead to uses
  that weren't properly designed for or vetted.
