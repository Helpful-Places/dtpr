name: Unequal performance across groups
id: unequal_performance
description: The risk that the AI system performs differently (typically worse)
  for certain demographic groups based on characteristics such as race, gender,
  age, disability status, or socioeconomic background. This can lead to biased
  or unfair outcomes that disproportionately impact vulnerable communities.
  Mitigations may include diverse training data, routine fairness audits, and
  regular performance monitoring across different demographic groups.
