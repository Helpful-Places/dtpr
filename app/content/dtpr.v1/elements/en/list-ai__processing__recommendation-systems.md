description: A technology that suggests items, services, or actions to users
  based on their preferences, behavior patterns, or similarities to other users.
  These systems analyze historical data to predict what might be most relevant
  or useful to a specific individual or group. In public spaces, recommendation
  systems can personalize information delivery, improve wayfinding, or enhance
  service efficiency. They typically employ filtering techniques that balance
  individual preferences with broader usage patterns.
