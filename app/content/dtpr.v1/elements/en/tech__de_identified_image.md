description: >-
  Generates still images of a sufficient resolution where individuals can be
  identified, for example by capturing images of faces or unique numbers such as
  vehicle license plates. However, images are processed in a way that removes

  *de-identified before first use* or *de-identified on device*), for example by
  blurring faces using computer vision.
