id: compromise_of_privacy
description: The risk that the AI system could access, expose, or deduce private
  information about individuals without their consent. This includes risks of
  data breaches, misuse of collected data, or the system's ability to infer
  sensitive characteristics from seemingly non-sensitive inputs. Mitigations may
  include data minimization practices, robust security measures, differential
  privacy techniques, and rigorous access controls.
