description: The risk that people place excessive trust in AI systems, leading
  to insufficient human oversight or inability to question algorithmic
  decisions. This can result in uncritical acceptance of AI outputs even when
  they are incorrect or harmful. Mitigations may include clear communication
  about system limitations, training for users on appropriate reliance, and
  maintaining meaningful human involvement in critical decisions.
