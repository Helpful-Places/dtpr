name: System Drift and Temporal Validity
id: system_drift
description: The risk that an AI system's performance degrades over time as
  real-world conditions change from those present in training data. This occurs
  when the relationships between variables in the real world evolve, but the
  model remains static, leading to increasingly inaccurate outputs. Examples
  include urban planning models that don't account for demographic shifts or
  transportation patterns that change seasonally or with new infrastructure.
