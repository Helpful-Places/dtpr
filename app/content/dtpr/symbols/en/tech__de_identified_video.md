description: Collects video footage of a sufficient resolution where individuals
  can be identified, for example by capturing images of faces or unique numbers
  such as vehicle license plates. However, the video is processed in a way that
  removes identifying characteristics before it is used or stored (known as
  *de-identified before first use* or *de-identified on device*), for example by
  blurring faces using computer vision.
