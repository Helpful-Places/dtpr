description: Data that is processed to remove identifying values, usually to
  protect privacy. De-identification can happen at any point in a data
  collection process, for example before it is stored in a database, or before
  it is published. Here we define it to mean after the data has already left a
  hardware device, or after it has been stored in a database. Find out more
