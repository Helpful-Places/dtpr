description: Audio data is collected that does or can identify individuals,
  either through manual review or technologies that can determine either what is
  being said, or who is saying it. Find out more about speech recognition or
  speaker recognition. Data is processed in a way that removes identifying
  characteristics before it is used or stored (known as *de-identified before
  first use* or *de-identified on device*). Find out more about
  de-identification [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification).
