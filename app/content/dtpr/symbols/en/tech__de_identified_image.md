description: Collects still images of a sufficient resolution where individuals
  can be identified, for example by capturing images of faces or unique numbers
  such as vehicle license plates. However, images are processed in a way that
  removes identifying characteristics before it is used or stored (known as
  *de-identified before first use* or *de-identified on device*), for example by
  blurring faces using computer vision. Find out more about de-identification
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification).
