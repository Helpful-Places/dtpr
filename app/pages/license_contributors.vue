        The open-source Digital Transparency in the Public Realm project was led by Helpful Places' co-founders during their tenure at Sidewalk Labs, and is currently stewarded by an emerging coalition of partners including Digital Public Square, Normative, GLIA Foundation, and the City of Boston's Office of New Urban Mechanics. The project is actively seeking new collaborators â€” from stewards to pilot opportunities and implementers, to funders and service providers - to help us test, improve, and advance adoption of the open source standard.
