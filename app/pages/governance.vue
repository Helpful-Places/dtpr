      <p>
        DTPR originated as a collaborative open design initiative at Sidewalk Labs in 2019, with contributions
        licensed by contributors under Creative Commons license CC BY 4.0. In 2020, Helpful Places became
        responsible for the stewardship of the DTPR project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helpful Places is an independent organization stewarding the DTPR standard, and offers solutions and
        services designed to aid in its adoption globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an open-source standard, the goal is for DTPR to be governed through an inclusive approach to ensure
        the standard evolves and changes in a manner that accommodates diverse perspectives, contemporary
        technologies, and practitioners around the world, yet maintains its principles, structure and practical
        application within the built environment. The ambition is that proposed permanent changes to the
        standard are validated by user research with the public, through consultation with the DTPR Community of
        Practice Council as well the Helpful Places team working day-to-day on the ground with the standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to the standard are communicated to all practitioners and the associated guides and assets are
        updated to incorporate any changes to DTPR in a timely way.
