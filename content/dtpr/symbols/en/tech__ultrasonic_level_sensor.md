description: Ultrasonic / level sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic
  waves. The sensor emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave reflected
  back from the target. Ultrasonic / level sensors measure the distance to the
  target by measuring the time between the emission and reception. Read more
