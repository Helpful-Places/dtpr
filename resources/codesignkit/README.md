This Co-Design Kit was developed for the co-design project [Designing for Digital Transparency in the Public Realm](https://sidewalklabs.com/dtpr), by Sidewalk Labs in collaboration with [Projects by IF](https://projectsbyif.com) and [Puncture Design](http://puncture.co).  

For this project we convened groups in cities around the world, co-hosting co-design sessions and holding online meetings known as “shareouts,” to collaborate and prototype an initial set of open standards for digital transparency in the public realm.  

At each of these co-design sessions, we collaborated to define the key themes that are important to communicate in the public realm. We also brainstormed concepts for communication systems (such as icons) and experiences (information tools such as apps) where these themes can apply.   

We are releasing this facilitation guide, along with all the materials used to support these sessions, so that anyone can use them to engage with the crucial topic of how technology is increasingly integrated into the public realm.

The Co-Design Kit includes:  
* [Co-Design Facilitation Guide](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/blob/master/dtpr_codesignkit/DTPR%20Co-design%20Facilitation%20Guide.pdf)
* Workshop Materials - both [print shop quality](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/tree/master/dtpr_codesignkit/Materials_ForPrint) and for [letter size printers](https://github.com/sidewalklabs/dtpr/tree/master/dtpr_codesignkit/Materials_LetterSize)
